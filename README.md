# 8-bit
Converts music files to an 8-bit rendition.

## Audio Analysis
We will use the 'Spectrogram Viewer.ipynb' Jupyter Notebook file to analyze different 8-bit audio samples. To do this, you will need to install a few things. 

First, install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) for Python 3.7. In the Anaconda Prompt, execute `pip install librosa` to download [Librosa](https://librosa.github.io/librosa/), a music/audio analysis library.

Next install [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/), an audio file type converter by running `conda install -c menpo ffmpeg`. You may have to do this in Administrator mode (run Anaconda Prompt as an admin).

Now, open Jupyter Notebook and navigate to your repository directory and open 'Spectrogram Viewer.ipynb'.
